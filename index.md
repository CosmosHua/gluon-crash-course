# A 60-minute Gluon Crash Course

This crash course aims to provide a quick overview of how to use Gluon, the
imperative interface of MXNet. It will teach

1. the basic usage of each component
2. training a basic neural network to predict images.

This course assumes that readers have basic knowledge about machine learning and
neural networks. Otherwise please refer to
[this excellent hands-on tutorials](http://gluon.mxnet.io/) to learn deep
learning from scratch.

notebooks are available in both [zip](gluon_crash_course.zip) and
[tar.gz](gluon_crash_course.tar.gz) format.
