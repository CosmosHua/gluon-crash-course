# Gluon crashcourse in 60 minutes

The goal of this tutorial:

1. Learn the basic components
2. Train a neural network to predict images 

This tutorial assume readers knows bascial concepts about ML. If not, then refer to book.

- [Manipulate data with `ndarray`](./ndarray.md) [10min]
- [Automatic differentation with `autograd`](./autograd.md) [5min]
- [Build a neural network](./neuralnetwork.md) [10min]
- [Training](./train.md) [15min]
- [Predict with the pre-trained model](./predict.md) [5min]
- [Use GPUs](./use_gpus.md) [10min]

(the structure is simliar to pytorch tutorial, we may want to ask pytorch http://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html. the contents are simplified from the straight dope)
